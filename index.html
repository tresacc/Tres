	<h2>Welcome</h2>
		<p>Tres Subdivision was created under the vision of developer Bill D’Amico, who in 1972, imagined a beautiful community along Lake Conroe. His investment foresight and community-building savvy resulted in the creation of one some of the most desirable properties in Montgomery County.</p>
		<p>Those homeowners who have become a part of his vision enjoy a peaceful and beautiful setting and increasing property values in an extraordinary environment.</p>

		<p>This site is intended to serve Lake Conroe Drive homeowners by providing <b>public information</b> regarding deeds and restrictions and general information about Architectural Control Committee activities.</p>

	<h2>Questions &amp; Answers</h2>
	  
	<h4>How can I submit building plans to the Architectural Control Committee (ACC)?</h4>
		<p>Plans can be submitted by email or in person to one of the ACC members. A response will be made in writing within 30 days. If a variance to restrictions is requested, please provide reasons for that variance. </p>
	
	<h4>Why do some Tres deeds vary from others?</h4>
		<p>When the developer laid out the neighborhood, he accommodated a variety of lot sizes which, at the time, required adjusted deed restrictions. Also, when the lots were being sold, the developer occasionally adjusted the restrictions on a case-by-case basis as seemed appropriate to him and the buyer. </p>
		
	<h4>Does Tres still need an ACC?</h4>
		<p>When our developer laid out the plans for Tres, he created the means by which  an Architectural Control Committee   might ensure aesthetic and functional continuity, while also providing the means for occasional exceptions to be made when and where they were needed. The majority of building has already been completed. However, as recent events demonstrate, the need remains to ensure that commercial and individual interests do not harm the community as a whole. </p>

  	<h4>Did the City of Conroe Annexation affect Deed Restrictions?</h4>
		<p>No, deed restrictions are not impacted by annexation and continue to apply  as they always have. <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/?link=LG" target="_blank">Info about Texas Annexation Laws is available here.</a></p>
		
	<h4>Are the older homes at the end of Lake Conroe Drive part of Tres Subdivision?</h4>
		<p>The eight properties at the end of Lake Conroe Drive are not mentioned in the <a href="Deeds/9214472 - Tres Plat 1992-3-30 .pdf" target="_blank">Tres Subdivision Plot</a>. Those homes are phase one of his three phases of development. (<a href="about.html#history">Detailed history provided here</a>). When Bill D’Amico set out to create phase 2 and 3 of his development, those homes were already built. When D’Amico sold his own home and the land directly in front of his home (both properties in phase one), he did  apply restrictions common to phase two and three to those two properties.</p>

  	<h4>Did the Tres ACC recently change deed restrictions?</h4>
	<p>No, the&nbsp; ACC did NOT recently change deed restrictions. The restrictions binding to Lake Conroe Drive Properties are those applied when the properties were sold, or the few easement agreements made for roads (<a href="Deeds/9131104 - 5.93 Acre - Private Street Maintenance All Parties Agreement.pdf" target="_blank">#9113004</a>) or utilities (<a href="Deeds/9456511 - D'Amico to Gulf States Utilities (easement) 10-4-1994.pdf">#945611</a>).</p>
		
	<h4>How does the ACC respond to complaints or violations?</h4>	
		<p>Historically, the ACC has responded when neighbors complain about others violating deed restrictions. In such cases, the ACC will seek ways to reconcile differences. In the event differences cannot be mended, a homeowner or the ACC may seek legal action for remedy as per our deeds.</p>
	
	  <h4>What can I do about a building on my property that may be in violation of restrictions?</h4>
	  <p>Talk to a member of the ACC. If your neighbors have no issues with your building, the ACC may be able to file a variance with the county on your behalf.</p>
	  
	  <h4>Are the ACC members looking for new violations on Lake Conroe Drive?</h4>
	  <p>No. But we do believe that working together responsibly, we can preserve the beauty and value of our neighborhood. We will, however, respond as best as we can to complaints as they arise.</p>
	  
	  
	  
	<h4>What is the difference between an HOA and an ACC?</h4>
		<p>A homeowner&rsquo;s association (HOA) is an organization in a subdivision that makes and enforces rules for the properties and their residents. An HOA has power to fine, <a href="https://housetipster.com/housetips/720/how-much-power-do-hoas-really-have" target="_blank">place liens against mortgages, and even foreclose on a homeowner&rsquo;s property</a>. Those who purchase property within an HOA's jurisdiction automatically become members and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hoa.asp" target="_blank">are usually required to pay dues or </a><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hoa.asp">HOA fees</a>. Tres has never had an HOA, rather, an ACC was created for Tres that ensures deed compliance. <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PR/htm/PR.202.htm" target="_blank">Both are governed under</a><a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PR/htm/PR.202.htm" target="_blank"> Texas law</a><a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PR/htm/PR.202.htm">.</a> In our opinion, an HOA is both unnecessary and potentially harmful for our small community.</p>
	  

	  
	<h4>How does the  ACC select officers?</h4>
		<p>Residents who care about and understand our neighborhood, have a history of getting along with their neighbors, and are willing to volunteer their time and resources are invited to serve. </p>
